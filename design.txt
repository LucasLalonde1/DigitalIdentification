Digitial Identification System 

WHAT IT DOES:

Users download the government of Nova Scotia application (They have one called HealthNS for healthcare I think i can convince them to add the ID part into a general application) where they can input their provincial drivers license, Health card, Fishing license, and every other form of identification, where they can then tap their ID on our ID Scanning machines, similar to a debit machine which takes payments, and whichever debit machine scans it will automatically present to the scanner the information that is needed from it. It does this by sending a get request to a backend API which determines the user, and which relevant information is needed for that user by the scanner machine.

THE MOCKUP:

Arduino ESP32 with pn532 nfc module and LCD screen display...
Backend API hosted on heroku in django language, with SQLite db temporarily

WHAT IT NEEDS TO BECOME:

I need some manufacturer of electronics to design and manufacture the finished machine.
I need a backend API which can communicate with the actual governmental data 
I need to talk to the government and get them to want it, which is why i have a paradox

I need to design the product to sell it to the government, but I need to work with the government to design the proper product.
